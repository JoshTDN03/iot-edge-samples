## Scenario Overview

| Scenario      | Overview      | Link          |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Edge Streaming Aggregation  | This sample creates two types of streaming aggregations: sliding (streaming time window - aggregation calculated in every incoming event) and jumping (database like time bucket - aggregation calculated end of every time bucket). The sliding aggregations can be sent to the Streaming Service rule engine | [streaming-aggregation](https://github.com/SAP/iot-edge-services-samples/tree/master/streaming-aggregation)  |
| Edge Persistence Aggregation  | This sample demonstrates use of the Persistence Service Java API.  This sample queries the Persistence Service at an interval.  The query aggregates data stored in the Persistence Service, and feeds this data back into Edge Services. | [persistence-aggregation-max-temp](https://github.com/SAP/iot-edge-services-samples/tree/master/persistence-aggregation-max-temp)  |
