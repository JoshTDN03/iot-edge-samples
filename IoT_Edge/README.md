This folder contains all the [SAP IoT](https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_IoT) Edge Samples for the Containerized Edge Services


## Scenario Overview

| Scenario      | Overview      | Link          |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Proxy Application Extension Service | This sample implements a Proxy application designed to operate with the SAP Edge Gateway Service REST. The application ingests user defined payloads measurement packets and forward it to the SAP Edge Gateway Service in the correct format. The application could also ingests binary file and forward it to the SAP IoT. | [proxy-app](https://github.com/SAP/iot-edge-samples/tree/master/IoT_Edge/customservice)  |
| DFT Algorithm as Extension Service | Simple implementation of Discrete Fourier Transform algorithm as Extension Service. | [dft](https://github.com/SAP/iot-edge-samples/tree/master/IoT_Edge/dft)  |
| Persistence Service Reference Application | xxx | [persistence-app](https://github.com/SAP/iot-edge-samples/tree/IoT_Edge/master/persistence-reference-app)  |
| Node Red IoT Add-on | Low code programming [Node Red](https://nodered.org/) dashboard and pre-configured flows capabilities to integrate SAP Edge Gateway Service, SAP Persistence Service, SAP Extension Services, including data consumption pipeline interfaces. | [node-red-addon](https://github.com/SAP/iot-edge-samples/tree/master/node-red-iot-addon)  |
| Edge Gateway Service Extension Service | Extension Service to interact with SAP Edge Gateway Service. This service invoke Edge Gateway APIs and listen for incoming measures in the Edge Message Broker, enforced with secure authentication. | [edge-apis-messagebus](https://github.com/SAP/iot-edge-samples/tree/master/edge-apis-messagebus)  |
